# QA Automation Case — Login & Sign Up

## Overview

This repository contains a **complete QA automation case** built on top of the *Real World App* using **Cypress**.

The goal of this project is **not only automation**, but to demonstrate **QA reasoning, test design decisions, validations, edge cases, and real-world issues** that commonly appear in production systems.

This case was intentionally structured as a **portfolio-grade project**, suitable for technical reviews by:

* QA Engineers
* Tech Leads
* Hiring Managers
* Recruiters

---

## Why this is a Portfolio Case

Unlike tutorial-style projects, this case focuses on:

* Test scenarios derived from **functional analysis**, not just happy paths
* Clear separation between **test intent** and **test implementation**
* Assertions based on **user behavior**, not brittle UI details
* Documentation of **known issues and system limitations**
* Traceability between test cases, automation, and insights

This mirrors how QA automation works in real teams.

---

## Scope of the Case

### Features Covered

* User Sign Up (Registration)
* User Login

### Test Types

* Functional validation
* Negative scenarios
* Field-level validations
* Business rule enforcement
* UX-related behavior (error messages, redirects, button states)

---

## Test Case Structure

Each test case follows a consistent pattern:

* **CT ID** (e.g. CT001-SU)
* **Scenario description**
* **Expected behavior**
* **Automation implementation using Cypress**

Example:

* `CT001-SU` — Successful user registration
* `CT002-SU` — Required field validation
* `CT003-SU` — Invalid email format
* `CT004-SU` — Password constraints
* `CT005-SU` — Duplicate email handling
* `CT006–CT010-SU` — Edge cases and business inconsistencies

---

## Automation Strategy

### Tools & Stack

* Cypress
* JavaScript
* Data-test selectors

### Key Automation Decisions

* Prefer **data-test attributes** over CSS selectors
* Avoid assertions tied to **specific UI text**, when behavior-based assertions are more stable
* Validate **navigation and state**, not only messages
* Use Cypress commands to improve readability and reuse

---

## Known Issues & Findings

During test execution, some **important system behaviors** were identified:

* Duplicate username validation is **not enforced** at system level
* Some error messages appear only after specific user interactions (blur/touch)
* Certain validations are handled inconsistently between frontend and backend

These findings are **documented intentionally**, as identifying gaps is a core QA responsibility.

---

## Why This Matters

This case demonstrates:

* How to think beyond automation scripts
* How to design tests that survive UI changes
* How to document limitations instead of hiding them
* How QA adds value even when the system has flaws

Automation here is a **means**, not the goal.

---

## How to Run the Tests

```bash
npm install
npx cypress open
```

Or headless:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

---

## Project Status

This case is **actively evolving**.

Future additions may include:

* Extended validation scenarios
* Improved assertions based on backend responses
* Documentation refinements

---

## Language Versions

* 🇺🇸 English (this document)
* 🇧🇷 Portuguese version available soon

---

## Final Notes

This repository is part of a **QA learning + portfolio journey**.

Feedback, discussions, and improvements are welcome.

Happy Testing 🚀
