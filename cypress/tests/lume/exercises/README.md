# QA Automation Case Study – Cypress Real World App

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents a **portfolio-grade QA Automation case study** built on top of the Cypress Real World App.

The goal is not just automation — but demonstrating:

- Test design thinking  
- Architecture decisions  
- Behavior-driven validation  
- Maintainability strategies  
- Real bug discovery  

This project reflects a **clear transition from QA to Quality Engineering mindset**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design realistic end-to-end scenarios  
- Automate critical user journeys  
- Validate business behavior instead of static UI text  
- Apply scalable test architecture  
- Document decisions and trade-offs

### 💸 Transactions & Payments

- Transfer with sufficient balance  
- Transfer with insufficient balance  
- Transfer using dynamic values  
- Edge case: negative value bug discovered  
- Transaction history validation  
- Empty state validation (“No Transactions”)

---

## 🧱 Test Architecture

Custom Cypress commands were organized by domain:

cypress/
└── support/
└── commands/
├── auth.commands.ts
├── bank.commands.ts
└── transaction.commands.ts

### Why this structure?

- Separation of concerns  
- Maintainability  
- Scalability  
- Clear domain responsibility  

TypeScript declarations were added via `index.d.ts` to ensure type safety for custom commands.

## 🧠 Automation Principles Applied

- Prefer behavior-based assertions over static text assertions  
- Validate navigation and state instead of UI copy  
- Use `data-test` attributes as stable selectors  
- Avoid brittle UI-dependent checks  
- Maintain clean Git history using Conventional Commits  

---

## 🐞 Real Bug Discovered

A critical business logic flaw was identified during exploratory testing:

> Sending a negative value during transfer increases the sender’s balance.

This behavior was documented as a system issue rather than masked by automation.

This demonstrates:

- Business-rule awareness  
- Edge-case validation  
- Exploratory mindset  
- Quality Engineering thinking
